Together with a native, he sets out for a \"conquest of the useless\" â€” or something.^-^<br/>then things get confused, and what begins as a journey turns into a trip far off the boundaries of so called \"logic\" and \"meaning\".<br/>With a storyline initially based on the prophecies of the seemingly most syncretic, ridiculous and pointless religion in the world â€” though really not any more syncretic, ridiculous and pointless than any and all other religions â€” computer-aided handdrawn 2D animation and 2D-3D-hybrid background art celebrate a renaissance of the unconscious, free from the technocratic structuralism of our times.<br/>for more information and free downloadable 1080p version visit schlaefferdesign.de/john-frum"
